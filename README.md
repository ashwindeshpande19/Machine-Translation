Transformation Rules 


if the first letter is a consonant, then that letter is moved to the end of the word and “ay” is appended, 
e.g., slow → lowsay


if a word starts with a vowel, then append “way” at the end, 
e.g., amoeba → amoebaway.


some consonant pairs like “sh” are moved together to end of the word with “ay” appended, 
e.g., shallow → allowshay.
